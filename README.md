# Pavel Stephan Muñoz

Tech Architect · Founder · Hands-on Engineer  
I design and build systems that deal with **complex rules, data validation, and automation**, with a strong focus on **clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability**.

I usually work **end-to-end**: from problem framing and architecture to implementation and iteration in production. I’m especially comfortable in **early-stage, high-ownership environments** and in **technical consulting contexts** where decisions matter.

## What I work on

I tend to focus on a small number of systems at a time, each exploring a different architectural concern.

### 🧠 RuleGenius (Founder)
**Domain:** rule engines, validation, data governance  
**Focus:** turning complex, evolving rules into explicit, testable systems  

RuleGenius is my main product initiative. It explores how to model, evaluate, and evolve rule-based logic without hard-coding it into application code.

Key ideas:
- Rule abstraction vs. hard-coded logic
- Human-readable DSLs for validation
- Versioning and auditability of rules
- Performance at scale

This project strongly informs my thinking around long-lived systems and governance-heavy domains.

### 💬 Form-Talk
**Domain:** conversational systems, workflows  
**Focus:** interaction as a first-class architectural concern  

Form-Talk explores how structured data collection can be modeled as a conversation rather than a static form.  
Architecturally, it leans into **event-driven flows** and explicit state transitions.

Key ideas:
- Conversation-driven workflows
- Decoupling interaction from data models
- Progressive validation

### ⏱️ CronCommander
**Domain:** scheduling, automation, orchestration  
**Focus:** reliable time-based execution  

CronCommander is an exploration of **control planes for scheduled work**: what runs, when, why, and under which guarantees.

Key ideas:
- Idempotent scheduled jobs
- Observability of time-based processes
- Explicit ownership of automation

## Selected Client Work (Private Systems)

### 🌱 Sustainability Information System (SIS)
**Context:** long-lived production system for an international sustainability organization  
**Status:** active, multi-year, real-world usage  

I led the design and implementation of a large-scale Sustainability Information System operating under real-world constraints: evolving standards, multiple stakeholders, and high data quality requirements.

Architectural challenges addressed:
- Data validation and quality enforcement
- Evolving schemas and backward compatibility
- Rule-driven assessments
- Auditability and governance
- Balancing flexibility with performance

While the codebase is private, this system represents some of my most demanding and instructive architectural work.

## How I like to work

- High ownership, low ceremony
- Clear boundaries and explicit trade-offs
- Systems that are understandable years later
- Fewer abstractions, but better ones

I work best with teams that value **thinking before scaling** and **simplicity over cleverness**.

I’m very comfortable working close to the system:

- Linux servers via SSH, without a graphical interface
- Long-lived processes, logs, and production debugging
- Google Cloud Platform, especially:
  - Cloud Run
  - Compute Engine (VMs)
  - Cloud Storage
  - Cloud SQL
  - Secret Manager

I prefer environments where infrastructure and application concerns are visible and understandable, rather than abstracted away by heavy platforms.

## Open to

- Early-stage or product-driven startups
- Founding / Staff / Principal engineering roles
- Technical consulting and architecture-heavy engagements

I’m less excited by bureaucracy-heavy environments, but open to the right problems and people.
